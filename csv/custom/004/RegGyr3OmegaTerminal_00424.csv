20,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_502","Lest you are unfamiliar, aetherochemistry is a wondrous field of science established by none other than the great Emperor Xande, who reigned until some 170 years ago."
21,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_503","In his boundless wisdom, he shone the light of science upon the enigma that was magic, and exploited such discoveries as were made for the betterment of the realm."
22,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_504","Since its inception, aetherochemistry has blessed Allag with unprecedented prosperity. Such prosperity as could be believed to endure for millennia─nay, for eternity."
23,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_505","While Emperor Xande's contribution to the science was immeasurable, we technologists who follow in his footsteps have also done our part for progress."
24,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_506","Our greatest breakthrough came twenty years ago, when we finally succeeded in activating the weapon."
25,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_507","At first, it communicated in some unknown language. As if sensing our confoundment, it began to acquire our tongue. In mere moments it mastered it. And it called itself Omega."
26,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_510","<blip> <buzz> We first discovered Omega some one hundred years prior."
27,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_511","It was excavated from deep within the earth, where it had lain for veritable eons as though a fossil."
28,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_512","Soil samples collected at the site told a startling tale: Omega originates not from this star."
29,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_513","Yet another source of mystery was its condition. Among the many scars it bore, there were those that could not be explained by its impact with the ground alone."
30,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_514","At the emperor's behest, we studied Omega intensely and in secret. Nigh everything about it was beyond the comprehension of our sciences, and it instilled us with fear and awe of what lies beyond the skies."
31,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_515","But then came a momentous discovery: Omega was ever so slowly repairing itself by absorbing the surrounding aether!"
32,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_516","There we found a common ground with aetherochemistry, and set about expediting Omega's repairs by infusing it with aether. In the course of observing the process, we attained many cues that gave rise to myriad new techniques."
33,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_517","And then, within my generation, we succeeded in awakening that which had long lain dormant: Omega's behavioral systems, or its consciousness, if you will."
34,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_518","While its functions are yet limited, it is fully capable of communication. It has even begun forging for itself a face, as if seeking to bridge the gap between us."
35,"TEXT_REGGYR3OMEGATERMINAL_00424_OMEGATERMINAL_000_519","Truly, Omega is a miracle of technology! Its discovery has advanced our civilization hundreds of years, and given time it will advance it hundreds of years more!"
