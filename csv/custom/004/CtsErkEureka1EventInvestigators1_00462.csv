12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_021","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition I-)Upon our arrival, we confirmed a number of the observations made by the previous expedition, including that the elemental forces appear to be in constant flux."
13,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_022","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition I-)Moreover, two members of the expedition, Krile Baldesion and Ejika Tsunjika of the Students of Baldesion, both claimed with certainty that Eureka was in fact the Isle of Val, an island off the coast of Sharlayan."
14,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_023","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition I-)The island, which once served as the headquarters of their organization, was believed to have been obliterated by a powerful magick. Assuming they are correct in their assertion, it begs the question how an entire island could have been moved from one side of the world to another."
15,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_024","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition I-)In light of this development, seeking out survivors has become our first priority. To that end, we will explore all avenues by which we might gain access to the Students' former headquarters, which at present appears to be encased in a magical barrier erected by unknown individuals."
16,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_030","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition II-)Under normal circumstances, the island's Aethernet would provide direct access to the headquarters of the Students of Baldesion. However, a preliminary survey revealed that the Aethernet was unusable. Restoring it to good working order therefore became our next objective."
17,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_031","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition II-)A more detailed analysis of the Aethernet conducted by Krile Baldesion led to the discovery of a confluence of aether─an unusual phenomenon which implied the existence of an obstruction in the flow of the Lifestream."
18,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_032","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition II-)A field investigation performed by <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> resulted in the collection of magicite, an exceedingly pure variety of crystal unique to Eureka. Upon its removal, the previously measured confluence of aether appeared to dissipate, strongly implying that the magicite was responsible."
19,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_033","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition II-)Alternatively, it may be the case that the magicite formed as a result of the confluence of aether. At this time, the precise mechanism remains unclear."
20,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_034","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition II-)Regardless, there was a measured improvement in the stability of the Aethernet as a result of the magicite's removal. Accordingly, we have decided that any additional pieces of magicite discovered should be collected immediately."
21,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_040","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition III-)Following the collection of all magicite located in Anemos, we confirmed a significant increase in the regional Aethernet's stability. Though it was still too dangerous to risk teleportation to other regions, this particular milestone was almost within our reach."

During this encounter, <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> bore witness to a memory─presumably that of the masked individual─owing to the power of the Echo."
24,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_043","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition III-)The memory was apparently that of four men─one a Lupin, another addressed as “Galuf”─discussing the fate of an entity that they eventually resolved to seal away on the Isle of Val."
25,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_044","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition III-)Upon hearing this testimony, Krile Baldesion concluded that the four men were the founding members of the Students of Baldesion─Galuf Baldesion, her adoptive grandfather, among them.
