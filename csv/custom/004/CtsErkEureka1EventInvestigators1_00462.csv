Assuming they are correct in their assertion, it begs the question how an entire island could have been moved from one side of the world to another."

Upon its removal, the previously measured confluence of aether appeared to dissipate, strongly implying that the magicite was responsible."
19,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS1_00462_INV00462_000_033","(-Eureka Anemos Expedition II-)Alternatively, it may be the case that the magicite formed as a result of the confluence of aether. At this time, the precise mechanism remains unclear."
