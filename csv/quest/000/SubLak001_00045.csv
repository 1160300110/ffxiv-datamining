1,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_01","After narrowly surviving Castrum Centri thanks to you, Rhesh tells you she had to leave the Crystal Braves to tend to her wounds. By the time she was well enough for duty, the organization was gone. She has found work as a guard in Revenant's Toll, a posting that keeps her quite busy. She has left one errand unattended, namely returning earrings to Rokka, one of the Doman children who healed her back to health. Thus, she leaps at your offer to find the girl for her, and tells you to speak with Rowena, as the children have been seen in her establishment."
2,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_02","Rowena informs you that the Doman children are helping her organize her wares, but are done for the moment. Should you care to wait outside of her establishment, she continues, you may very well catch sight of them playing."
3,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_03","You find all four members of the Doman Adventurers' Guild, led by a somewhat frustrated Yozan. After returning the earrings to Rokka, you learn the cause─none of them know of any quests to undertake. However, Shiun has heard whispers of something mysterious hidden just outside of town, and Yozan invites you to accompany them there. Make your way to Camp Revenant's Toll, and take a look around."
4,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_04","Somewhat discouraged by the ruin that greets them, the Doman Adventurers' Guild nevertheless begins to search for the buried treasure. Join in their search, and see if you can find anything of value at all."

6,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_06","Yozan is disheartened to learn that even you could find nothing but junk. However, Koharu reminds him that old wine can be quite valuable, and Shiun suggests you take the bottle to Slafborn for appraisal. Knowing that children caught with liquor will not be treated lightly, Yozan asks that you ask the questions in their place."
7,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_07","Slafborn is mildly amused by the bottle, and informs you that you have, in fact, found the rumored treasure of Camp Revenant's Toll. In the past, the settlers survived the hard days and long nights deep in their cups. They took to calling their wine “treasure,” which then attracted some more dim-witted adventurers to the dangerous land. Worried, the frontier hands then came up with a ludicrous horror story to keep these unwanted people away. As time went on, the tales of “treasure” faded to legend. Find Yozan outside of Rowena's establishment, and relay this information."
8,"TEXT_SUBLAK001_00045_SEQ_08","Despite the fact you found very little, Yozan realizes that this was still a proper quest with his favorite adventurer. He seems satisfied for the moment, but you have a strong feeling that such an adventurous spirit will not remain so for long."
