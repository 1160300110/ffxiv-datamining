※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_01","Amh Garanjy is ecstatic that the choir performed better than anyone could have hoped. Now that the show has ended, it is time for the children attending the concert to receive their gifts. Unfortunately, a shortage of parcels leaves several youngsters disappointed, with one little girl in particular convinced that her own bad behavior is to blame. Her timing could not be worse, as she runs off in tears at the exact moment the Saint of Nymeia arrives with a whole shipment of presents for the Starlight Celebration. Amh Garanjy cannot help but wonder as to her whereabouts, and requests that you track down the wayward youngster."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_02","You commence the search by asking those in the vicinity if they have seen a crying girl run past, starting with Simpkin the troubadour. He clearly recalls seeing one heading in the direction of New Gridania. Although the fact she has already covered a considerable distance is a cause for concern, there must surely be others with useful information to share."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_03","Following your first lead, you approach a nearby Wood Wailer. Unfortunately, he has no recollection of seeing the child you seek, but advises asking around the Adders' Nest. For lack of more reliable clues, you decide to take his suggestion."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_04","Lieutenant Gavin of the Twin Adders has seen the girl making her way to the Acorn Orchard. It seems the net is closing on your young quarry. Desperate not to miss this opportunity, you race off in pursuit."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_05","Gavin's information proves reliable, and the girl is still fighting back tears when you find her. She confesses that she ran away from her father following an argument about a floral hair decoration, and has not seen him since. Maisenta appears, giving the child the dainty accessory she had asked her father to buy, before persuading the runaway to return to him and apologize. Much like the girl, you are surprised that Maisenta knew all about the hairpin, and the trader takes great delight in revealing her secret. Impressed by both her generosity and resourcefulness, you decide to return to the amphitheatre to tell Amh Garanjy of this festive miracle."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_06","Upon your return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, Amh Garanjy is relieved to hear that you and Maisenta were able to not only find the girl, but send her back to her father with a smile on her face. While it seems that your contributions to the Starlight Celebration have all but secured its success, there is still time before the end of the festival to take up your conductor's baton, should you wish to lead the choir in song once more."
