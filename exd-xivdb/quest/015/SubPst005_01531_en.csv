As the conjurer pores over the tome she received to glean what information she can, it may be best to do some investigating of your own. Start by speaking with Aedoc, the missing man's sister, who currently resides in Quarrymill."

Return to Stillglade Fane and inform Braya that this whole ordeal has been a rather unfortunate waste of her time."
