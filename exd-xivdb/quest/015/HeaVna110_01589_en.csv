2,"TEXT_HEAVNA110_01589_SEQ_02","Considering all that you and Lord Artoirel have done on behalf of Falcon's Nest, Ser Redwald cannot in good conscience impose upon the two of you any longer. He gives you his blessing to return to Ishgard, and affirms his intent to deliver a glowing report to the Holy See. It would seem your services are no longer required, but before taking your leave, you might ask Lord Artoirel if he requires anything else."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA110_01589_SEQ_03","Speaking with unaccustomed candor, Lord Artoirel admits that he long harbored doubts regarding your competence and motives, in part perhaps because Lord Haurchefant\xe2\x94\x80his bastard half-brother\xe2\x94\x80holds you in such high esteem. When forced to decide who would pursue the heretics, he turned to you not out of an eagerness to bring Ishgard's enemies to justice, but out of a dark desire to see you fail. But after witnessing your willingness to risk all for the cause, as well as the aftermath of your handiwork, he sees that you are every bit the hero Lord Haurchefant claimed, and swears never to doubt you again."
