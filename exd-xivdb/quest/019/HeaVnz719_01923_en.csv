1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ719_01923_SEQ_01","Hervoix has been worrying over the list of tasks given to him by O'bhen Tia, unsure of which one to procrastinate on doing first. Eventually he decides to take care of the beasts that have been stalking the forest to the east. Or rather, he decides to have \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03you\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 take care of them. Head to the eastern camp and speak with Guenaret for any information regarding your targets' whereabouts."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ719_01923_SEQ_02","After speaking to Guenaret about the oversized arachnids, you learn that O'bhen Tia himself demanded that Guenaret wait until someone was sent to settle the problem. Although \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03you\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 were not actually the one meant to do the job, Guenaret seems eager to be rid of the menace. Go north and search for any signs of the beasts, which are said to resemble giant spiders.  "

With his chief's intentions still a mystery, he gives you your reward and begrudgingly returns to his list of tasks."
