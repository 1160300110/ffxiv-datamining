To prevent this terrible eventuality, he asks that you launch a preemptive strike by destroying three findertype magitek vangobs G-III near the Arkhitekton in the Dravanian hinterlands."

The Illuminati laid hands on old Garlean magitek weapons, disassembled and rebuilt them into something even stronger. Though Holepix is impressed by the ingenuity involved, he also knows they will not hesitate to enslave their fellow goblins, and hopes your efforts will forestall the Illuminati."
