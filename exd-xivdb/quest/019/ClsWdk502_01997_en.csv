Though the head has broken off, he proceeds to identify it as Ishgardian in origin and fawn over its quality. He feels that such a treasure must be returned to its rightful owner, and asks you as a well-traveled adventurer to visit the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly in Ishgard. Make your way there, and find a veteran knight who might be able to tell you to whom the spear once belonged."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_02","You speak with a veteran knight, who informs you that the broken spear is most likely that of a long-dead member of the order. He directs you to this man's son, Barthovieu, known to frequent the Brume."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_03","Barthovieu, a lowly soldier, accepts the broken lance in amazement. He tells you his father was weak, a knight who left to fight Dravanians, but instead died an honorless death at the claws of mere beastkin. Barthovieu now lives in squalor as a struggling single father. For the sake of his son, he means to earn himself knighthood by hunting dragons. However, he needs a bow to do so, and would ask you to make him one after he can scrape together the necessary funds.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next carpenter quest will be available from Barthovieu upon reaching level 53."
