She explains that fishing is a popular pastime amongst goblins, and the resulting demand for squigglywogs is helping her turn a tidy profit. While the goblins plan to settle a town in Idyllshire, Midnight Dew suspects that many goblins are just natural-born wanderers. She doubts it will be long before Feltsmox feels the need to leave the city and travel the realm."
