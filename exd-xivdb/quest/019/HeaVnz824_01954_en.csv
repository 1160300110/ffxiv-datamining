Since he has not yet fully recovered, he has requested your help in following this goblin. He asks you to meet him and Dedean outside of Idyllshire, in the Answering Quarter. Accompany them on their investigation and make sure they don't cause any problems."

Notched Bone is sure that the goblins are responsible, but the man insists he was not attacked by them. Notched Bone abandons the man, running back to Idyllshire to plan his next move. Fortunately, the man does not seem to be worried about his own condition, instead expressing concern at Notched Bone's apparent misunderstanding of the situation. Return to Idyllshire and find out what Notched Bone is intending to do next."
