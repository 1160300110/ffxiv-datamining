She plans to head south of the Saint Mocianne Arboretum to cut off the bandits from their means of escape, and asks you to meet with her there to help her hunt them down."

With the skiff still empty and no sign of the bandits in the vicinity, she concludes that they must be holed up in the hills. She proposes that you head up into the hills to flush the thieves out while she stands guard against their escape."

A pair of burgling blackguards attempt to ambush you in a narrow pass and you are forced to cut them down. Return to Midnight Dew south of the Saint Mocianne Arboretum to inform her of all that befell."

With several bandits still on the loose and half her property still in their hands, she asks that you continue to lend her your invaluable assistance to track down the last of the thieves."
