Slowfix explains that, since taxing the citizens of their hard-earned gil would fly in the face of all that this fledgling nation stands for, funds are raised through rental of vital tools and equipment. Unfortunately, a goblin has borrowed a pickaxe and left Idyllshire without returning it. Find this ungracious goblin and retrieve the pickaxe."

While she can't return to Idyllshire herself to return the pickaxe, she entrusts it to you, requesting that you return it to its rightful owner in her stead. Go back to Idyllshire and give the pickaxe back to Drydox."
