1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ822_01952_SEQ_01","Dedean still seems to think that the goblins of Idyllshire are somehow brainwashing the immigrants that arrive in the settlement. He saw a goblin leading a group of adventurers\xe2\x94\x80who had just arrived in Idyllshire\xe2\x94\x80out towards the Saint Mocianne Arboretum. He has convinced himself that they are being taken there to be brainwashed and is not interested in anything you have to say to the contrary. Maybe if you find out what the goblin and his party of adventurers \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03are\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 doing, you can explain it to this Lalafell and disabuse him of his delusions."

Speak next with the goblin himself and confirm that there is nothing even slightly suspicious going on."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ822_01952_SEQ_03","The goblin guide does not even know what brainwashing is, much less how to go about doing it. Just as expected, he is simply showing the new arrivals to Idyllshire what they should be aware of as citizens of the settlement. Hopefully this will be enough to assuage Dedean's suspicions."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ822_01952_SEQ_04","Dedean still seems unwilling to believe that the goblins are truly kind and friendly. It seems he has had some bad experiences during his time in Ul'dah that lead to these unfortunate prejudices."
