However, the goblin she has sent to survey the site, a novice by the name of Boomshox, has yet to return. She bids you to head into the Dravanian hinterlands and check on Boomshox's safety."

She is keen to conclude her survey as quickly as possible, but the local wildlife insist on interfering with her work. She asks you to slay five crawlers in the vicinity of the Answering Quarter, so that she might finish her fieldwork in peace."
