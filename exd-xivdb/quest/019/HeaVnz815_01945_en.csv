However, Halfsix lacks the necessary aetherflow distributors to make his analysis. As with many things in the burgeoning settlement, it appears these, too, are located somewhere within the Arkhitekton. Thus, Halfsix bids that you make your way there and search the Illuminati pots for three of these tools."
