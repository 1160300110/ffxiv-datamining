Pipin now sends word of a discovery, and asks that you come to the Hall of Flames."

Upon close inspection, Urianger divines that Y'shtola invoked a forbidden teleportation magick and was sent to an unknown location. In order to find her, you must follow the trail of her passage through the Lifestream, starting from the spot the spell was cast. Join Urianger at the Sil'dih excavation site, that you may begin the search."

He adds that no soul can survive for long in the midst of its restless currents. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Alphinaud resolves to petition the aid of the Elder Seedseer. Make haste to Gridania, and join Alphinaud at Nophica's Altar."
