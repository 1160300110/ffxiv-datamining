After her father takes his leave, Heustienne opens up to you about her past. You learn that she is a war orphan, and became a dragoon that she might honor her adoptive father. The tale concludes with Heustienne remembering that Ser Alberic wished a word with you. Take yourself to the Observatorium at your earliest convenience."
