1,"TEXT_JOBNIN520_01684_SEQ_01","Akagi's letter is a call to action: Princess Yuki is attempting to breach a Salthound base, and may have need of your help. Find out how you might be able to from the retainer, who is waiting near Memeroon's Trading Post in upper La Noscea."
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN520_01684_SEQ_02","Unsurprisingly, the princess is displeased to see you, and has little to say about your offer of assistance. Akagi, meanwhile, all too gladly explains that the Salthounds are in possession of a trading record that is passing through the black markets. Somewhere within this log, he says, there should be information on the Yatsurugi clan's stolen treasures. After this explanation, the retainer then turns to ask Yuki to use you shinobi, only to find that she has already left to infiltrate the base. Oboro quickly outlines a plan to aid her entry: use smoke bombs to distract the guards. Make your way to the designated areas, and defeat any guards attracted by your diversion."
3,"TEXT_JOBNIN520_01684_SEQ_03","Your role in diverting the guards' attention has succeeded. Rendezvous with Oboro and Akagi near Poor Maid's Mill to see how they have fared."
4,"TEXT_JOBNIN520_01684_SEQ_04","After a brief moment of panic, you turn to see that the puissant princess has already successfully infiltrated the base and returned with the prize. For better or worse, she did not notice the part you played from the shadows. Return to the dock storehouse, and consult with Oboro."
5,"TEXT_JOBNIN520_01684_SEQ_05","Though you failed to win over the princess, Oboro nevertheless thinks the day a success. He asks that you now devote yourself to quiet meditation, wherein you might realize new skills and strategies based upon your experiences.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 54."
