He insists on accompanying you to the proposed parley with Nidhogg, and Alphinaud warily consents, on the condition that he stay his lance until words have proven ineffective. Before you can begin your mission, however, you must first convince Ser Aymeric to forestall any military action that might jeopardize your negotiations. Make your way to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and speak with the sentry on duty to be admitted to the Seat of the Lord Commander."
