Alas, your progress is halted soon after by a powerful energy barrier which threatens to tear the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enterprise\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 apart. Frustrated, Cid turns the airship around and sets course for Ishgard, lamenting the Allagans' knack for making the simplest of tasks so infernally bloody complicated."
