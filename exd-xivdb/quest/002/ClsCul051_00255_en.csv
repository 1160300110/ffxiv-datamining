Happily, his urge to better your efforts prompts him to forget his woes, and he gifts you a amateur's culinary knife, that you might compete on an even footing. Now armed with a secondary tool, you continue along your chosen path.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 10."
