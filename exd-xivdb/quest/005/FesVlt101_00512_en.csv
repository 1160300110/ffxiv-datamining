However, while the service was intended to aid those shackled by shyness, they have received requests from another, unexpected source: those who would gladly present their gifts directly, if only they knew where their loved ones were. Hortefense has pledged to locate these absent sweethearts, but as a stranger to these lands, he has thus far met with little success. Hence does he seek the assistance of learned adventurers to find these missing men, and ensure that no love goes unspoken this Valentione's Day."

60,"TEXT_FESVLT101_00512_HORTEFENSE_000_014","However, there are some who have sought out our services for another reason: they lack not the confidence to confess their love, but merely the knowledge of where their loved ones are.
