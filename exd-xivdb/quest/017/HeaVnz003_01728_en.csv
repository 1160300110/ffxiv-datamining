He tells you the lady of the noble house he served was accused of heresy, leading to a series of events that ultimately ruined the family and cost him his employment. But rather than drown his sorrows in wine, he asks that you take the bottle to his former lord, as a token of appreciation for allowing him to serve the family. Deliver the bottle of mulled wine to the title-stripped lord, who you are like to find near the airship landing."

While he is touched at his former knight's concern, he has already resigned himself to the judgment of Halone, and has prepared to take an airship to parts unknown with his son. However, his son is missing, and he is starting to worry. He asks that you find his son before they are late for the flight."

His father vowed to do all within his power to save the boy's mother and see justice served. Unfortunately, justice was not what they expected it to be. As the boy turns to leave for the airship landing, he cannot help but wish there was more he could have done to protect his mother."
