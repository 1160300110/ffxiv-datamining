1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_01","You happen across a young man torn between personal desires and obligations. As a young boy, he promised he would wed when he came of age. This runs counter to his present goal of becoming a Temple Knight, which forbids marriage while undertaking training. He shamefully admits he cannot recall the girl's name, but remembers she was a ward of House Haillenarte. He asks that you find her and tell her she need not worry of fulfilling their promise. Speak with Bartelot outside Haillenarte Manor and see what you can discover."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_02","You speak with Bartelot at Haillenarte Manor. While there is no shortage of wards under the care of their house, he supposes Lady Laniaitte would be of an age with the woman you seek. Speak with Lady Laniaitte at the Rosehouse in the Sea of Clouds and see what she knows."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_03","You speak with Lady Laniaitte and learn she has heard of no such promises of marriage. However, she is certain that Marielle is of the right age for the girl you are after. Speak with Marielle about the promised marriage."
