Seeing the dates listed for the test flight leaves him gravely concerned, as he predicts significant dragon activity at that time. Rather than delaying the shipment, he suggests hastening repairs on the airship. Speak with Fromelaut at the Skysteel Manufactory and see what can be done about the repairs."

Though he is hesitant to do so, he agrees to do whatever is necessary to make repairs as quickly as possible. Report to Cliaux and tell her it will be ready on the appointed day."

She tells you that conflicts with the Dravanian Horde make even simple airship deliveries a trying task, but the cooperation of the astrologians and machinists, under the guidance of the Holy See, has ensured safe passage through the skies of Ishgard."
