2,"TEXT_JOBMCH502_01705_SEQ_02","Rostnsthal is reluctant to join the celebrations, claiming he had little influence over the result of the contest. Ignoring his protestations, Celestaux promises to drag the instructor back to the workshop while you approach Count Baurendouin de Haillenarte about releasing Joye early from her manor duties. Make your way to Haillenarte Manor, and speak with the count."

4,"TEXT_JOBMCH502_01705_SEQ_04","You arrive back at the manufactory, and the count announces the reason behind Joye's conspicuous absence: the young lady has wed. As is custom in Ishgard, the newly married Joye has resigned from her duties at both the manor and the workshop, leaving Stephanivien and her colleagues short a talented machinist. In the event that Joye does not return, you must train with renewed intensity to fill the void left by her departure.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien upon reaching level 52."
