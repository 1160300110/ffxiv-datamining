However, something about the hunter's attitude fills Loupard with trepidation, and he has asked you to look after Q'yantaa once more. Speak with Bauricoin and make sure Q'yantaa will be safe with her new partner."

Hurry and inform Q'yantaa of this tragic turn of events."

She will hurry back to Tailfeather to inform Loupard of Bauricoin's infraction of the camp's long-standing rules. Follow her back to the camp to watch the drama unfold."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_06","Loupard is disgusted at Bauricoin's selfish and deplorable actions, summarily exiling him from Tailfeather. Although the search for Q'yantaa's partner must begin anew, the forests of the Dravanian forelands are a bit safer thanks to the strict rules of its chocobo hunters."
