1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ023_01748_SEQ_01","Laniaitte asks you to obtain a wing sample from a gaelicat, an adorable yet ferocious cloudkin native to the surrounding area. She warns you, however, that these creatures are very delicate. Only a perfectly preserved sample will suffice, and she doubts that she or her men could fell them while leaving their leathery appendages intact. No matter how many gaelicats it takes, she implores you to retrieve one of their wings."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ023_01748_SEQ_02","You have slain several gaelicats to no avail. But as Laniaitte said, you must not grow disheartened. Continue slaying gaelicats in search of a suitable sample."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ023_01748_SEQ_03","You obtain an undamaged wing from the gaelicats. Deliver the specimen to Laniaitte."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ023_01748_SEQ_04","You return to the Rosehouse with the sample, and Laniaitte is more than impressed by your delicate precision. As it turns out, the wing sample was requested by Atelloune, a naturalist of no small renown, who is hard at work on an article for \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03New Eorzean Geographic\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03. Her piece on cloudkin physiology is sure to be a smashing success due in no small part to your assistance."
