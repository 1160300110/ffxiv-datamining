2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ306_01798_SEQ_02","You arrive on scene to find Marcechamp's tracker on her knees, apparently having been attacked by the chocobo standing over her. As you approach, the chocobo runs off in the direction of the Hundred Throes. Give chase, and be ready for a fight should it come to that."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ306_01798_SEQ_04","Since you were the one to put the mighty chocobo to its rest, the tracker thinks it best that you should be the one to inform Marcechamp of the final battle. Head back to Tailfeather and make your report."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ306_01798_SEQ_05","You have informed Marcechamp of the battle that transpired near the Hundred Throes. He informs you that because chocobos are highly intelligent animals, they must be put down if they get it in their minds to attack people, as it is the chocobo's primary purpose to serve, not harm."
