1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ019_01744_SEQ_01","Ingaret has been tasked with driving away the upland mylodons on the far side of the Black Iron Bridge. The bridge needs repairs, but the craftsmen cannot work safely when there are monsters within pouncing distance. Ingaret is not confident that she can take on so many beasts at once, so kill three of the monsters and she will finish off the rest."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ019_01744_SEQ_02","You make short work of the mylodons. Return to Ingaret so she can do her part."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ019_01744_SEQ_03","Ingaret thanks you for your help and pays you your share of the bounty on the beasts. She also tells you about a farm on the far side of the bridge. It has fallen into disrepair, but if the mylodons are driven away completely, it might be possible to rebuild it."

Not the craftsmen!\x02\x10\x01\x03I'd ask the dragoons to do it, but they're so busy it'd be weeks before they found the time.
