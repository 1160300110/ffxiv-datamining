The new lord regent has demanded to be served a platter of highest-quality letter puffer at his next banquet, a fish thought to be long extinct. Should the chef fail to provide the fish, his life will be forfeit.

In the ensuing exchange, Ansaulme confesses that the tyrannical regent is in fact his younger brother, making him the rightful heir to House Rougecarpe. He pledges to bring an end to his brother's reign of terror by finally accepting his inheritance. After satisfying his old friend that his travails are nearly over, Ansaulme turns the conversation back to his favorite subject\xe2\x94\x80fish.
