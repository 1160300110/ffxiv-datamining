However, she also wishes you to turn Elde down in no uncertain terms should she wish to make a substantial order. The toll of large-scale trade with Ishgard would simply be too costly for the life in the Black Shroud. Make your way to the Jeweled Crozier, and speak with the merchant."

As her shop is newly opened, she asks that you serve as an advisor, and consult with her about leatherwork. Your first task, so to speak, is speaking with the shopkeeps along the Jeweled Crozier, for something is not right in the markets of Ishgard."
