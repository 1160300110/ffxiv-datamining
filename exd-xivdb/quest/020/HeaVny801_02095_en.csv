They turn to Rowena's House of Splendors to supply them with the objects of their desire, and the consortium employs various tradesmen to procure the collectables in question. Such an opportunity is now available to you, should you be so inclined...and willing to receive payment in the form of scrips redeemable only with the House of Splendors."
