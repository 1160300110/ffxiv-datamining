1,"TEXT_CLSWVR600_02006_SEQ_01","The time is almost come for Averil to leave for the front lines of battle, and, unsurprisingly, she has decided not to tell her mother. Subsequently, she asks you for raiments suited for conjury in a style that will raise no suspicion. She bids you once again question the best-dressed townsfolk to learn what garments are in style this season."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR600_02006_SEQ_02","Opinion amongst Ishgard's socialites seems split between doublets and bliauds. Return to Averil, and offer her a choice between the two."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR600_02006_SEQ_03","After a moment's thought, Averil decides she would prefer the doublet. The reason is simply that there is an old doublet in her house, one that Glenda may have worn in times long past. Yet there remains the question of fabrics: what could best be tailored to fit a conjurer's needs? Consult Redolent Rose in Ul'dah to find out."
4,"TEXT_CLSWVR600_02006_SEQ_04","Upon hearing of Averil's plan, Redolent Rose realizes that the essence of Ishgardian art\xe2\x94\x80fashion included\xe2\x94\x80is transience. Many of the young who leave for war never come home, and are as candles burning brightly but ever so briefly. Returning to the matter at hand, the guildmaster tells you that chimerical felt may be the perfect fabric, as being both wonderfully warm and absorbent of aether. Fashion now a chivalric doublet of healing, and deliver it to Averil near the Arc of the Venerable."
5,"TEXT_CLSWVR600_02006_SEQ_05","Averil gratefully accepts the doublet. She briefly laments that she cannot tell her mother she is leaving, and bids you to see her and Freskin off from the Arc of the Worthy. Await them there, that they have someone to say good-bye to."
6,"TEXT_CLSWVR600_02006_SEQ_06","Dusk has fallen over the Holy See as Averil and Freskin arrive. Both thank you for seeing them off, and are just turning to leave when Glenda appears. The widow has seen through her daughter's charade, and reveals her own tale of loss: she went to war as a young woman, to protect Averil's father. She failed, and found herself with child but without her lover. When Glenda learned Averil meant to follow the selfsame path of conjury, she panicked and did all she could to stop her daughter\xe2\x94\x80and so inadvertently pushed Averil towards the battlefield. Glenda does not agree with Averil's decision, but she has chosen to support it. You watch as Averil walks away with Freskin, mayhap to return, mayhap not."
