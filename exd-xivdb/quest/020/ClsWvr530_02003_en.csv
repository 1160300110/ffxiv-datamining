Glenda does not approve of this clique, and so has hidden Averil's favorite dress to prevent her from going.

You listen politely at first, but after the second bell you can feel your eyes glazing over, and by the third you are sleeping on your feet. Just when you think you can take no more, Glenda announces it is time for her to head home. Return now to Averil near the Arc of the Venerable, and pray that this ordeal has not been for naught."
