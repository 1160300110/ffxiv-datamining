While the sight of the young birds setting out on the first leg of their life's long journey is soothing to the soul, the decomposing piles of leaf litter and broken eggshells they leave behind are less welcome. The moogle asks you to scour the heights of Zenith for the fledglings' abandoned nests and bring them back to him."

If you should ever wish to try a hot cup of sticks, feathers, eggshells, and regurgitated worms, then the unmaneuvering moogle is the chef to speak with."
