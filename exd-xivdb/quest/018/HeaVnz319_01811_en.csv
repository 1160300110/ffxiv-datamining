He cannot say for certain, but he believes his sibling may be lost somewhere in Mourn. Search the cavern of Mourn for the missing dragon youngling."

One mention of his brother, however, quickly sends him flying toward the exit. Head back to the indomitable wyvern and see if his younger brother has returned safely."

He thanks you and looks down to his little brother, hoping the young dragon will also pay respects. You are offered only silence as he flies off without saying a word. The indomitable wyvern quickly apologizes, promising his brother will be dealt with in short order."
