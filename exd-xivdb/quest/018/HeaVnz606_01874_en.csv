1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ606_01874_SEQ_01","A memorial service was recently held to honor Ser Chlodebaimt, third son of House Haillenarte. Though no one expected Camp Cloudtop's Rose Knights to abandon their duties for the ceremony, the Haillenarte knight was surprised to find not a single one in attendance. He would not dare question Lady Laniaitte, but his good friend Rontremont worked closely with Ser Chlodebaimt, and he is certain he would have attended if time allowed. That is why the Haillenarte knight wishes to offer him the battle standard raised during the ceremony as a memento. Deliver the battle standard to Rontremont at Camp Cloudtop."

He tells you of how Ser Chlodebaimt gave his life for his men, and that he was an exemplary leader. Despite his close relations with Ser Chlodebaimt, however, he feels there is another more deserving of that tattered memento\xe2\x80\x94Lady Laniaitte, sister to Ser Chlodebaimt."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ606_01874_SEQ_03","Lady Laniaitte welcomes you with a warm greeting, but quickly turns sullen at the sight of the battle standard. She recalls that her brother was a great man, well loved by his men, and their readiness to seek vengeance for his passing. But rather than dwell on the pain of the past, she believes it best to live her own life and strive for a better future."
