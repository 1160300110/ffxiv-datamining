As Khloe Bajhiri of Gridania's \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03The Raven\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 tells it, Commander Vorsaile Heuloix insists that it is simply a Garlean diversion, but the savvy reporter is convinced that forces far more sinister are afoot. To answer her earnest plea, seek out proof of the otherworldly nature of the disturbances, that you might secure a scoop worthy of \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03The Raven\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03's front page. Witnesses have sighted the supernatural storms in various locations: south of Fullflower Comb in the East Shroud, south of Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud, southeast of Horizon in western Thanalan, south of Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan, northeast of the Foremast in middle La Noscea, and south of Costa del Sol in eastern La Noscea.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbPlease note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended.

Deliver it to Commander Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest to prove his theory in error, then prepare to report your findings to Khloe Bajhiri."

As the mighty mage herself explains it, an oversized golem of her creation went berserk, raining destruction upon the land with no rhyme or reason\xe2\x94\x80though given that the construct's original purpose was to conquer Eorzea in its mistress's name, this could be seen as a fortunate turn of events. Shantotto has returned to her realm, but her rampaging minion remains behind, leaving you and your fellow adventurers to see that it wreaks no further havoc upon the realm."
