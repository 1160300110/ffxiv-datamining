2,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_A1_000_1","Ask about kettles."
3,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_A1_000_2","Ask about Gerolt's masterworks."
4,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_A1_000_3","Have one of Gerolt's masterworks repaired."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_A1_100_3","Ask about Ironworks gear augmentation."
6,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_A1_200_3","Ask about Zodiac Weapon replicas."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_A1_000_4","Nothing."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_010","I became Master Gerolt's apprentice in hopes of training under the realm's greatest weaponsmith. Instead I'm helping him pay off his debt by mending kettles."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_011","It's probably just as well, though, seeing as he's hardly ever in a fit state to teach me. I find I make far better progress during my time alone."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_020","Before he became a slave to drink and debt, Master Gerolt produced some of the finest weapons and armor Eorzea has ever seen. Even today, his masterworks are prized by the wealthy, who pay good coin to have them in their personal collections."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_021","Alas, such individuals are often ignorant of the special care such superior articles require. And so, rather sadly, most of the samples of Gerolt's masterworks have aged poorly, and beyond normal methods of restoration."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_022","Fortunately for us, however, ancient Allag had ways of overcoming this problem\xe2\x94\x80the \xe2\x80\x9csands of time\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9coil of time.\xe2\x80\x9d With these substances on hand, even with my limited skills, I am confident that I can return Master Gerolt's creations to their original condition."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_023","Should you come to possess one such article and desire it restored, please allow me to take on the task. I ask for no payment in return\xe2\x94\x80the experience will be reward enough."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_031","Ah, yes, the Ironworks gear. Master Gerolt told me that I was to handle their augmentation."
15,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_032","Truth be told, at first I was sorely disappointed. I thought that it would be no different to mending kettles, and that I would learn nothing...as usual."
16,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_033","Well, my fears were quickly put to rest when I had occasion to tend my first piece. From the materials used to the techniques employed, everything about Ironworks gear was unlike anything I had ever seen before."
17,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_034","And small wonder, seeing as they are born of Garlean ingenuity. Whatever people may say about the Empire, there is no denying that it stands at the forefront of innovation."
18,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_035","Now, after all this praise I've lavished on the gear, you may wonder why they still require work in order to fulfill their potential."
19,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_036","Well, the answer is that it is not easy to replicate Garlean techniques with materials found in Eorzea. Miss Jessie of the Ironworks has done an admirable job with limited resources, but there is still room for improvement."
20,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_037","The Allagans used to strengthen equipment with a substance called carboncoat and a material called carbontwine. Both are known to turn up in ancient ruins."

23,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_040","Ah, I had wondered when you would ask. A while ago, Master Gerolt bid me find a way to replicate your Zodiac Weapon, to create a copy accurate down to the very last hundredth of an ilm."
24,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_100_041","I believe his true motive in asking for such was the potential coin it could earn to fund his carousing. Nevertheless, I have taken it upon myself to fulfill his request as best I am able."
25,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_041","It took many sleepless nights, but I have at long last found a way! If you but present me your Zodiac Weapon, I can forge a perfect copy. Moreover, I can make every version of it, from humble relic to glorious Zeta."
26,"TEXT_REGFSTARMORCRAFTSMANDISCIPLE_00162_DRAKE_000_042","Of course, it goes without saying that the replica will not have the same qualities as the original. But in appearance alone, only Master Gerolt could tell one of mine apart from the true arm."
