Hochländer - gestählt durch das harte Bergleben - größer 
und muskulöser als die ihnen verwandten Wiesländer.

leicht zu merkende Namen geben, darf man wohl als Zugeständnis

Meeresmetropole Limsa Lominsa. Zwischen vielen kleinen Inseln
und Felsen sind große Eisenbrücken gespannt, die zusammen
mit den kreideweißen Häusern die Silhouette der Stadt zeichnen.
Zu den wichtigsten Gewerben zählen die Fischerei, der Schiffbau,
das Schmiedehandwerk sowie der Seetransport. Unter dem
Oberkommando von Admiral Merlwyb verfügt Limsa Lominsa über
eine starke Kriegsflotte, der es jedoch noch nicht gelungen ist,
die Raubzüge der Piratenbanden ganz unter Kontrolle zu bringen."
1981,0,0,0,"Gridania","","Im Osten Aldenards, umgeben von dichten Wäldern und wilden Flüssen, liegt der
Stadtstaat Gridania. An den Ufern der Gewässer stehen große, rustikale Holzbauten,
die der Stadt ihre einzigartige Atmosphäre verleihen. In Gridania florieren nicht
nur Forst- und Landwirtschaft, man trifft auch Meister des Schreinerhandwerks 
und der Gerberei. Außerdem hat in der Stadt das Klageregiment seinen Sitz.
Dieses schlagkräftige Einsatzkommando patrouilliert regelmäßig im Wald
und trägt Sorge für die Sicherheit aller Einwohner."
1982,0,0,0,"Ul'dah","","Im Süden von Aldenard erhebt sich inmitten der trostlosen Wüste
die Handelsmetropole Ul'dah, deren Stadtbild von den massiven
Stadtmauern und dem kolossalen Palast im Zentrum geprägt ist.
Offiziell wird Ul'dah von einer Sultana regiert, doch im Hintergrund
ziehen die sechs Oligarchen des Scorpio-Kreises die Fäden.
Der enorme Wohlstand der Stadt resultiert aus dem Handel,
dem Textilgewerbe sowie dem Bergbau.
Berühmt-berüchtigt ist die Perle der Wüste für die martialischen
Kämpfe im Kolosseum und die einschlägigen Vergnügungstempel."
