de Vylbrand, dans la mer de Rhotano. La Cité s'étale également sur plusieurs 
petites îles alentour, reliées entre elles par des ponts d'un blanc éblouissant. 
Vue de la mer, l'architecture limséenne est d'une beauté et d'une élégance à 
couper le souffle, et les bardes y ayant voyagé la surnommèrent "le Voile de 
Llymlaen", en référence à la déesse de la navigation, vénérée dans la ville. 
Ses industries les plus florissantes sont la pêche, la construction navale, la 
métallurgie et le trafic maritime. L'Amiral, leader choisi parmi les citoyens, 
dirige une formidable armada. Bien que la ville maîtrise la quasi-totalité des 
mers éorzéennes, les continuelles exactions des pirates sont une injure à la 
puissance limséenne."

centenaires et parcourue d'innombrables cours d'eau. C'est en son sein que se
cache la Cité de Gridania. Les bâtiments construits en bois sont en parfaite
harmonie avec l'environnement sylvestre et de nombreux moulins à eau
fournissent l'énergie nécessaire aux habitants. Ces derniers protègent la forêt
et plusieurs unités de gardes, comme les célèbres vigiles sombres, patrouillent
jour et nuit pour assurer sa sécurité."

dans l'arène, ou des jeux du casino qui font et défont les fortunes en l'espace 
de quelques secondes, les distractions ne font jamais défaut dans cette ville. 
Elle prospère également grâce au commerce, à l'exploitation des mines de la 
région et à l'industrie textile. Officiellement, c'est une dynastie royale qui est 
à la tête de la Cité, mais le pouvoir réel est détenu par une oligarchie 
composée des six personnages les plus riches et les plus puissants de la ville, 
surnommés le Cartel des Scorpions. Les dieux marchands Nald et Thal, qui 
partagent un même corps, sont les protecteurs d'Ul'dah. Deux temples leurs 
sont consacrés, respectivement à l'est et à l'ouest de la ville."
