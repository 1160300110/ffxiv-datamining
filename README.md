## Helping out

Getting started in datamining is quite easy. If you enjoy digging around CSV database files then you've come to the right place! The best place to start would be:

- Download this repository and start looking at the files in the `/csv` folder
- Download **SaintCoinach** and use either the `SaintCoinach.Cmd` or `Godbert` tools.
	- Saint provides releases: https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach/releases

If you find a connection between files or an identification of data, throw up an issue on the repository and it will be sorted :)

- Connection between files could be an number in 1 column that matches the numbers in another column or even another file
- Identification of data could be values in a column that have a meaning and a pattern can be observed (eg ClassJob ID, or Craft Level)
