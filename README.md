This repository is to serve as a place to share data mining information related to Final Fantasy XIV.

# Helping out
If you want to help with mapping data, click **Download ZIP** to download the repository (about 45mb), there are a lot of CSV files. You can open these and begin to match columns. It is a bit tedious and I hope to make a tool that will make the whole process simplier!

# Data Mining Tools
## FFXIV Explorer

This is one of the best applications to just get stuck in with and get going somewhere. It is very well polished, has an excellent 3D model viewer.
