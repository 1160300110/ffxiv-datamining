## Helping out
To help out, first you need a tool. They're all listed below. FFXIV Explorer can list data information through its application SaintCoinach has Godbert which can also do the same. Each tool provides a viewer for the EXD information as well as the index offsets in the header column.

If you find a match between data, just throw up an Issue and we can sort it from there :D
